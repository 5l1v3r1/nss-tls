Overview
========

nss-tls is a name resolving library for glibc
(https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/), which performs DNS queries over HTTPS
through 1.1.1.1 (https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/dns-over-https/).

Architecture
============

nss-tls consists of two parts:
  - nss-tlsd runs in the background and receives DNS resolving requests over a
    Unix socket
  - libnss_tls.so is a tiny client library which delegates the resolving work to
    nss-tlsd through the Unix socket and passes the results back to the
    application. This way, applications that take advantage of nss-tls are not
    affected by the complexity and the resource consumption of the libraries it
    depends on, or the constraints they impose on applications that use them.

Dependencies
============

nss-tls depends on:
  - glibc (https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/)
  - GLib (https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GLib)
  - libsoup (https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/libsoup)
  - JSON-GLib (https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/JsonGlib)

nss-tls uses Meson (http://mesonbuild.com/) as its build system.

Usage
=====

Assuming your system runs systemd
(https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/):

  1) meson --prefix=/usr build
  2) ninja -C build install
  3) systemctl daemon-reload
  4) systemctl enable nss-tlsd
  5) systemctl start nss-tlsd
  6) ldconfig
  7) Add "tls" to the "hosts" entry in /etc/nsswitch.conf
